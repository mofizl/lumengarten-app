Flutter iOS Configuration Fixed
==================================

Date: 2025-08-29
Issue: "Application not configured for iOS" error in GitHub Actions

Root Cause:
- Flutter iOS support was not enabled globally
- This caused the build to fail with "Application not configured for iOS"

Solution:
- Executed: flutter config --enable-ios
- This enables iOS platform support in Flutter configuration
- Verified with: flutter config --list (shows enable-ios: true)

Status: 
- âœ… Flutter iOS configuration is now properly enabled
- âœ… iOS platform should now be recognized in CI/CD builds on macOS
- ðŸš€ Ready to test complete iOS build pipeline in GitHub Actions

Note:
- iOS builds still require macOS with Xcode (cannot build iOS on Windows)
- But the Flutter configuration issue is resolved
- GitHub Actions on macOS-14 should now successfully recognize iOS platform

Next: Test CI/CD pipeline to verify complete iOS build works
